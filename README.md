# Ring Kings

Ring Kings is a simple Amazon affiliate website showcasing popular boxing gear. The site lists curated products with affiliate links and now features a more polished design using Google Fonts and styled buttons.

## Running Locally

You can view the site by opening `index.html` in any modern web browser. To serve the website from a local server (useful for deploying online), install the dependencies and start the server:

```bash
npm install
npm start
```

The server will be available at `http://localhost:3000`.

## Deploying

The site can be hosted on any service that supports Node.js or serves static files. Copy the repository contents to your hosting provider and run the start script above, or configure your service to serve the static files in this directory.
